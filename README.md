# word_game

The first player chooses a word and writes it. The second player has to guess which word it is, by writing each letter at a time.

If the wrote letter is present in the word, it will be displayed in the respective position inside the word. If not, the number of wrong guesses will be incremented by one.

If the second player reaches 3 wrong guesses, the player who chose the word wins.
